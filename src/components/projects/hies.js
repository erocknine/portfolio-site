          <p className="p-solo">Maintaining the HIES Inc. brand of environmental conservation and sustainability, the redesigned page includes natural green, blue & brown colors with updated high-resolution images following nature themes, and original content text trimmed for brevity. This site was created with React & Redux, React Router for URL routing, and several libraries for animations and image control.</p>

          <p className="p-solo">The original HIES Inc. website was a static company page due for a makeover. The original page was created with older web development habits such as keyword stuffing and duplicate content, with unintuitive UX/UI design choices. The images on the page were also outdated for higher resolution monitors, and the content was plagued with an overabundance of text and disorganized pages. Generally, all things that hurt SEO.</p>

        <div className={ projectDoc === 'hies' ? "project-portion":"project-portion closed" }>
          <p className="p-solo">With SEO optimization a priority, I made sure to include key words relating to their business, their services, environmental work in meta tags, and included clear descriptions in image alt tags and in the content itself.</p>

        <div className={ projectDoc === 'hies' ? "project-portion":"project-portion closed" }>
          <p className="p-solo">I redesigned their company logo for sharper colors, and remade their hero image for higher resolution using Adobe Photoshop. To reinforce the hero image's theme of clean water, I implemented a visually realistic water-motion effect by incorporating PIXI.js to run a displacement filter script. And yes, the site went through several stylistic choices before arriving at the current one. The CEO eventually wanted to keep their original logo.</p>

        </div>

        <div className={ projectDoc === 'hies' ? "project-portion":"project-portion closed" }>
          <p className="p-solo">For overall design, I chose modern and minimalistic images since the main concern was to modernize their page in the first place. Just as important if not most, their home page became more business oriented by plotting out their business process, adding a "Request a Quote" section, utilized cute & playful icons, all with user-friendliness in mind.</p>

          <p className="p-solo">HIES provides over 20 services, each one requiring some kind of documentation. To make their website more manageable, I reorganized all their services into four main categories: GIS, Consulting, Assessment, and Remediation. This redesign project ultimately became a complete overhaul of their business logistics.</p>
        </div>

        <div className={ projectDoc === 'hies' ? "project-portion":"project-portion closed" }>
          <p className="p-solo">I created a services section which included cursory details and relevant images per service, organized by categories, and included a keyword search feature to help users easily search for a service. Implementing the search feature required rendering the services from an array of service objects. When a user searches, the array is filtered for an object matching the keyword, and the respective component in the object is rendered.</p>
