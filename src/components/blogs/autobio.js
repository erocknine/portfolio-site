      <p className="blog-text">June 27, 2020 | 14 min</p>

      <p className="blog-text">A partial venting and recollection of the prime of my life.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">TLDR: My first two years after college was spent in Japan visiting Love Hotels, indulging in a comfortable Japanese life, working as an English Teacher for a work visa, then quitting and working as a cook in Shibuya. Little would I know, this would nudge me into the food industry.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">

      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">In 2019, I had no idea where my life was heading. I was the manager of a sushi restaurant in Brooklyn, and like any kitchen, the usual day was filled with monotonous labor accompanied by hectic, adrenaline-fueled lunch crowds and the dread of knowing the next day would be the same.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Restaurant work is retail for food, and dealing with customers is a drag all young people know about, amirite? A good friend hooked me up with the job because I honestly needed something to stay busy after taking a 3 month break, and I was on this break because previously in 2018, I was the owner of my own restaurant business, and I had consciously ended my professional streak.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Why, you ask? Well, many reasons. And though it's none of your business, I've been wanting to recollect my journey anyhow.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I'd been in the food industry for most of my 20's. I'm sure my parents were real glad I put my 4 year college degree straight to work in the kitchen. My journey to that point started from a series of food industry jobs I accidentally indulged in, ignited by my time living in Japan.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">The year was 2012, and I was studying abroad in Tokyo, Japan, with my girlfriend of 4 years, Raquel. We met freshman year, and like a fool, I believed her when she said she was fine being just friends with benefits. Unknowingly, she was the only consistent thing in my 20's besides my complete lack of direction in life. Our relationship being without a doubt, is one of the greatest posessions I have.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/sexy_waifu.jpg" alt="My beautiful ride or die girlfriend." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">We studied abroad at Soka University in Hachioji Japan, and let me tell you, for a country with an enormous porn industry, their culture spends a lot of its time indulging in sex while pretending none of it exists at the very same time.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Our dorms were separated, all boys for me and all girls for Raquel. I will say right now, I was horribly frustrated. Sexually. In case it wasn't apparent in my writing. Here we were, in a foreign country with my girlfriend and we were trapped in two different living spaces for 5 months.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">The only solution? The Love Hotel 15 minutes away from the dorm. During our time, we actually spent time at several of these hotels. One was further away with a really cool pipe technology I've only ever seen on TV. When time came to pay for the room, a canister would rush along this transparent pipe into an opening. You'd grab the canister, put the cash in, send the canister back through the pipe, and another one would come wooshing over with your change.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">These hotels were amazing. There'd be non-stop porn on every channel of the TV, an amazing bath, some had karaoke machines, and there was usually an incredible massager that I used for getting the knots on my back. Yup, massager, and that's all I used it for.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Some people should know though, that after a certain time, these rooms require you to pay for the entire night as opposed to hourly. We learned about this the hard way, and when it was past 9PM, the doors were locked until we paid for the entire night. For the first time, I saw a Japanese woman act very non-Japanese as she pushed us back into the room, refusing to let us out because we hadn't paid the full nightly rate despite us having only been in the room for 5 minutes. We were studying abroad with no job and limited resources, and we just wanted to have sex, not drop $100 dollars when we were expecting to spend $50.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">So, we spent the night just to see what it'd be like. I was mad and petty though, and I've never liked being told what to do, or to have someone else determine what freedoms I have. When morning came around, I took the incredibly large and soft cushions in the room and tossed them out the window. We paid, got the hell out, then retrieved the pillows from the street and ran back to the dorm. I would've taken the massager too, but honestly the vibe of small-time Yakuza was all over this place, and I didn't want any of that.</p>
      
      <p className="blog-text">After our study abroad, which was more than trying to have sex all the time and you'll have to take my word for it, we decided to stick around Japan and really live the Japanese life. We wanted to experience real Japan and real Tokyo.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Raquel and I were real adults in a foreign country after all, and this wasn't our first time living together living away from home. So before even finishing our semester, we met with a realtor and found an apartment in Nishitokyo, Japanese for West Tokyo. Upon moving in, we bought kitchen supplies, furniture, a kotatsu, bought a futon and literally carried it over my shoulder a mile home, and really settled in. We had bike routes to the mall, grocery stores, to the Miyazaki Ghibli Park, to shopping centers like Kichijouji... and life was great.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/apartment.jpg" alt="Our apartment in Nishitokyo." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">We continued eating great food, seeing the sights, and traveled all around Tokyo. We had day trips to Yokohama to visit the Pokemon Center and cup noodle factory, and we had our usual spots at all the prime locations like Harajuku, Shibuya, or Akiba. WE frequented Hobby-Offs and House-Offs in random parts of Tokyo for second hand toys and furniture, and spent entire days exploring new locations by foot.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Our time in Japan couldn't be all leisure though. My first obstacle was finding a job, specifically one that could grant me a visa. For anyone who's lived abroad, teaching English is usually the easiest way to stay in the country, and that is what I did. This wasn't my preferred profession because who wants to teach English? Certainly not the other 50 year-olds English teachers I worked with, definitely not. I simply needed a work visa, fast.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Prior to landing the job, my student visa had actually expired for nearly 4 months already, officially marking me as an illegal immigrant in Japan. I was living dangerously, and the thrill was not lost on me. Please don't be mad Japan, you've taken enough of my money as it is.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I was constantly applying to jobs, and only survived because my smart, beautiful, master of the universe girlfriend was stuck with the rent as she'd already gotten a job as an English teacher at an international elementary school. Clearly, she was brilliant, I was not. I remember applying to Gymboree, and though the manager was from LA and spoke English, the job was demanding, underpaid, with a terribly long and expensive commute. Then I tried tutoring at a children's afterschool program, only to realize I was terrible with kids.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Only after some testing and interviews did I land the job at NOVA Jibun Mirai. I will say, teaching at Japanese private English Schools... I wouldn't recommend it. It was miserable, and Japanese professional work culture can be ridiculously demanding in subtle ways. Things were mundane, and I remember eating the same yakigyudon (Japanese fast food, grilled beef bowl) from Chikarameshi every day. Literally, I ate it every single day of the week. I did that. Kind of sad thinking back to it now, but at the time the meal was the most economical for its amazing flavor.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Besides that, I actually met other colorful characters from different walks of life there. I met an Aussie who married a Japanese woman, an Englishman who married a Japanese woman, and a third or fourth generation Japanese American guy from California who was trying to connect with his roots. And there was the Japanese girl working the front desk who had a crush on me. And a Japanese student from Canada who stopped talking to me after I told her I had a girlfriend. I tried not to pay them any mind, but I like the attention.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/suit.jpg" alt="The suit and tie with converse shoes I wore as an English Teacher." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">Things were okay for a while, but the day I decided to quit was not from fatigue of wearing a suit every day or the train ride to Ikebukuro beside the other dead-eyed salary men, but the very moment my manager said I wasn't allowed to drink water during a lesson. A lesson that consists of mainly talking, she told me I was not allowed to drink water because "Japanese teachers do not drink water". "Bullshit," I said, and gave my notice while continuing to bring water to the rest of my lessons. I'm a fiend for water. Always have been. Maybe it's my dry skin, I don't know, but to reiterate, I don't like being told what I can and cannot do.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I didn't get emotional over the job. Honestly, quitting immediately after securing my work visa was the plan all along. In fact, I had already stayed too long for comfort, especially when they transferred me to a school in Mitaka for a month. I wanted to take advantage of my time in Japan, and yearned for something fun and exciting befitting my youthful age.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Cue Casita Aoyama. Casita was a restaurant in that middle part between Harajuku and Shibuya, you know, the cool limbo place if you've been. I got the job after posting on Tokyo Craigslist asking for bartending jobs in Shinjuku, and instead received a response asking if I would work at a fine dining restaurant in Shibuya. "Close enough," I said.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">The guy who messaged me turned out to be the current Sous chef, a quirky Japanese man who previously lived and worked as a sushi chef in Los Angeles. His English was decent, and his name Takashi Takeuchi. He and the chef, Kenichi Iwata, were fun and possibly my best friends throughout the rest of my time in Tokyo. I know, two middle-aged guys were my best friends during my early 20's. I'm not ashamed.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/taka_and_ken.jpg" alt="Eating yakiniku with Takashi and Kenichi." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">They were a complete contrast in character to the people I worked for at the English school. I could only attribute this personality disparity to the difference of job culture. Kitchen work is down to earth with no time for foreplay or the bullshit.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">In fact, that's what I loved about culinary industry. There was no need for resumes. No need for fake banter or compliments, or to convince anyone why it was your life's goal to be a cook for this employer. If you had knife skills, could work the line without breaking and wasn't an obvious asshole, bring all of that to the kitchen and the work you demonstrate will be the interview.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">And that's how it started. I was paid minimum wage with no tips but met the greatest people I could ever work with. Also, yes, the comparison that I lived potentially the Mexican analogy in Japan was not lost on me. Mexicans in America just have it a lot worse.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Growing accustomed to the routine at work, the chef handed me more responsibilities. I became dessert cook, testing new recipes like creme brulées, white wine jellies, panna cottas, and it was fantastic. Only later I realized, I simply love the feeling of being responsible for something important. We'd generally have the same few course menu items, but the dessert would switch up, and it was my responsibility to test, create, and ultimately serve.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Days were pretty routine. I'd get to work around 10AM, stay until 6PM or later if we were behind on prepping, but on some nights after work, I would walk to Miyashita Park and dance with people there. A little bit of background information so this doesn't seem weird, I was a breakdancer since high school days, and was deeply obsessed during my time in NYC, Philly, and Southern California. By this time, I'd already been dancing for around 8 years and had already considered a career in professional dancing. Yeah, it's weird being young.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Miyashita Park was one spot of many I'd been to for public dance practice locations. I'd actually been to places around Tokyo where the youngins would dance next to the office buildings in Shinjuku, and even to Sophia University which was crawling with English speaking international students, also with a large dance influence. I've forgotten how I even learned about these gatherings, but I guess I was quite resourceful.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/bboy_miyashita.jpg" alt="One of the days breakdancing at Miyashita Park with my Audio Technica speaker." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">Astonishingly, one night at Miyashita Park, I met two other male dancers from Canada living in Tokyo for school. If anyone has lived overseas, you'll know the feeling of meeting other people who spoke your language, that emotion of sudden joy and familiarity. My eyes lit up as I introduced myself, and we started practicing together. I'd see them a few more times during my life in Japan but ultimately, I never had a chance to say goodbye when I finally decided to leave Tokyo.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">And that time came over a year later. My father back in Philadelphia started getting health issues. He'd gotten a mini-stroke over the winter shoveling snow, then began losing his teeth. I couldn't help but think there was a correlation between the sudden decline of my parents' health to me being absent from my parents' life for two years.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Then, Takashi informed all of us in the kitchen he was moving away to work in Germany, and Ken was leaving the restaurant as well. I realized time really had passed by. Things were constantly moving and changing, people were outgrowing this place, and I'd been coasting. I hadn't set any clear goals for myself past this job, and though Raquel was content teaching English, we both knew neither of these were grounds to stay in Tokyo.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">So with a heavy heart, we cut our time short in Japan, and booked tickets back to America.</p>

      <h1 className="blog-header one">My 20's - Part Two - Diving into the Food Industry</h1>
      <p className="blog-text">June 29, 2020 | 9 min</p>

      <p className="blog-text">A partial venting and recollection of the prime of my life.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">TLDR: Upon returning to NYC, Raquel and I struggle to search for a passion. I self-publish a book, then unconsciously build a resume of kitchen experience at numerous restaurants around the city, completely ignoring the money and loans spent on a college degree. A high paying job at Smorgasburg food market in Brooklyn ultimately inspires me to start my own food business.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/highline.jpg" alt="Raquel sitting at Highline Park eating an onigiri in NYC." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">The food industry is brutal. You're exposed to temperature extremes, dangerous tools, long hours, strict deadlines, and grumpy people. I didn't know what to do upon returning to the States. I didn't have a plan, didn't have experience in anything, and just as Anthony Bourdain had prophesized, I only ended up in the food industry like many others because I defaulted.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">As I've previously said, getting a kitchen job is easy because you simply need the skills. People hiring for a kitchen don't really care what kind of person you are; your personality is just a garnish. Most won't even interview you. You just need to demonstrate the ability to do capable work under pressure and that's it. They'll throw you into the fire with a trail, and if they like what they see, you're hired. And in NYC, kitchen jobs are ALWAYS available.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I've worked in numerous places in NYC. Bond St. serves great employee meals. 15East's kitchen is filled with the most underpaid multicultural immigrants I'd ever seen which at the time included Indonesian, Filipino, Mexican, Japanese, Chinese, and Malaysian. $9 an hour. SkyIce was the same pay, a local mom & pop shop in my neighborhood who makes their own unique flavors of ice cream.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">$12 an hour was the highest I found, and they were all the same mundane, tedious labor. I wish I was more aware but it's hard to notice the direction your life is taking when you're busy living in it. I was moving from one restaurant to the next hoping I'd end up with something more profound. The jobs were easy, I'm a fast learner, and none of them indulged my need for responsibility, for something that made me feel important. I begged the gods for a path because Anthony Bourdain's guidance had worn thin.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Thinking back now, my parents must've been upset that kitchen work was what resulted from a 4 year college degree, but they never said anything of it. They always respected my decisions. I mean, a little helicopter parenting would've been nice, no?</p>

      <p className="blog-text">This is why I decided to take a break from the food industry for a year to write a novel. In 2014, I quit SkyIce, sat down, and over a course of several months wrote a 400-page novel based on an idea that came from a dream. I wanted to complete it, to flesh out the details, to create the characters, and to draw the world using words.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/kings.png" alt="My novel, Kings of Fortune." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">A good friend of my brother, Steve, was the first to read it. The fact he didn't throw the book out of the window immediately upon reading made me forever indebted to him. He finished the book to the end before my brother did, and I know because he knew details about the characters and plot that was only explained at the very last chapter. Steve, you're an amazing person.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Unfortunately, it was only the months after completing the novel did I learn that writing is 50% of the work of being an author, and marketing and luck is the rest. By this point, I paid my friend to create the cover art, paid several book review companies to review the book, and sent out copies to some people I found on Goodreads along with payment to review my book on Amazon and Goodreads.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">By the end, San Francisco Book Review awarded my book 5 of 5 stars, and Portland Book Review gave my book 4 of 5 stars, and reveled in the fact my characters were colorful with great female characters. That was the greatest compliment of all, that I wasn't going to be a horrible example of men writing women. </p>

      <p className="blog-text">Personally, this was all I wanted, and was perfectly fine with stopping this pursuit of writing. I had finished my creation, sent it out to the world, and it returned with smiles. My novel was objectively not bad, and that was good enough for me. This was after all merely a quarter-life crisis, and I needed money again.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Then, my brother began dating a chef who offered me another line cook job for PizzaMoto at Smorgasburg food market in Brooklyn. I'd never heard of Smorgasburg, but the pay was better, and I've always loved festive events. Smorgasburg was an outdoor food market featuring over a hundred independent businesses from around Brooklyn. On top of that, the crowds were real, literally non-stop for 8 hours straight. How could I not have heard about this market that took place every weekend during the summer?</p>

      <p className="blog-text">There's a culture among the vendors at Smorgasburg as well. It's a small community, and everyone knows each other. A lot of places do discounts for other vendors if you simply say you work at a particular booth, but most places trade. Wherever you're working, just prepare an item from the menu and bring it to another booth to trade. When I worked at Seaport outdoor market, I even traded with the Haagen Daz store for milkshakes. Everyone wants to trade, you just need to ask.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/pizza_moto.jpg" alt="Standing in front of PizzaMoto booth." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">Then, PizzaMoto stopped their outdoor markets after opening a brick & mortor; every pop-up restaurant's goal I presume. But, I was on the move again. This time, I got a job at Lonestar Empire, one of the original vendors at Smorgasburg selling brisket sandwiches, owned by Dennis Ngo who is the owner of restaurant Di An Di in Greenpoint. This job would completely alter my future in the food industry.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Shamefully, I at the age of 25, had never had real BBQ or even heard of smoked brisket. But Dennis didn't mind. I already had a wealth of experience in high volume markets, the knife skills, and the ability to learn fast, and I did. I quickly learned about the structure of the brisket, which has the fatty, juicy section called the point, and the leaner portion on the bottom called the flat. These two pieces intersect when you're slicing, so you'd have to consciously pay attention to the grain where the sections meet. If cooked properly, both point and flat are equally juicy and utterly delicious.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">And I will say this here. Good brisket should be eaten without sauce. If your brisket needs sauce, it is not good brisket. I should note, during the earlier days, a customer asked how much sauce they should add and I shamefully recommended squirting sauce all over the plate. What a damn fool I was. You live, you learn.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Every day at the market, I would set up the stall in the morning and open at 11AM, and for the rest of the day I proceeded to single-handedly collect money and cut brisket for sandwiches until 6PM. There could be anywhere from 300 to 400 covers (customers), up to 14 whole briskets, taking in thousands of dollars, and I was responsible for all of it.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I became a brisket cutting master, and started becoming familiar with everyone. At Brooklyn Flea market in Fort Greene, I even started trading sandwiches for Lego figures a vendor was selling. Within two market days, I went home with Captain America, Ironman, Hawkeye, and even the Hulk Lego figures.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">On another occasion, I actually served Jason Sudeikis and his wife Olivia Wilde. I could tell it was Jason immediately despite the baseball cap and sunglasses, because I watch SNL like, a lot. When he ordered, I asked the usual, "Would you like the lean, or moist?" Jason says, "Lean." I reply, "Shame, moist would've been sexier." He laughs, I laugh, the customer behind him laughs. Then he doesn't tip. Oh well.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">For the first time, I felt what it was like to make money. I was paid $150 a day regardless if I sold out and left early, and tips would total around $50 to $100. And the job was exhilarating. I splurged. I ate out all the time, bought things on impulse, and forgot the stress of budgeting.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/lonestar.jpg" alt="Lonestar Empire booth at Smorgasburg with my tip sign, 'Please tip! My girlfriend is high maintenance but she thinks she's low maintenance!'" />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">"So this is how white people live," I thought to myself. I realized this was the amount of money people needed to be paid to live comfortably.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">By 2015, I actually worked two jobs; one at Lonestar Empire and another at car share company, Zipcar, doubling my income.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Eventually, drama at Zipcar ensues because the manager wants me to work weekends, even though I specifically informed them I couldn't work weekends when I started. I would be an idiot to give up my Smorgasburg job because I earned more from the two days at market than an entire week at Zipcar. So, I protested and refused working weekends. The manager was mad and petty, said I wasn't a team player, and wrote me up for insubordination. A month later, they fired me.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I didn't care though. My plan was the same ever since I learned the inner workings of Lonestar Empire. Dennis's successful business had inspired me to start my own business, and I was rushing to save up for it. His business was genius. His profit margins were high, his menu was simple yet highly desired among customers, and the necessary labor was low. His business was so efficient he was able to pay someone like me double the market rate, which in turn filled me with job satisfaction and incentive to do a better job.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">So, I found a part-time at INSA and X'ian Famous Foods during the off winter season, continued saving money, and eventually opened my own booth at Smorgasburg Market in 2016.</p>

      <h1 className="blog-header one">My 20's - Part Three - Starting a Food Business</h1>
      <p className="blog-text">July 6, 2020 | 10 min</p>

      <p className="blog-text">A partial venting and recollection of the prime of my life.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">TLDR: After being accepted into Smorgasburg, I partnered with a cook I've previously worked with hoping to ease the responsibility of owning a business. A combination of low profits in the first week and myself demanding a higher percent of the profits causes my friend to leave the partnership. Learning from previous mistakes, I refine my business model, menu, logistics, and succeed at Smorgasburg Market with a hefty profit.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">
        <img className="blog-image__img" src="/images/blog-images/autobio/banzai_smorg.jpg" alt="My own booth at Smorgasburg." />
      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">There's been a recurring theme in my life of me making conscious decisions while unconsciously failing to see the bigger picture. Even during the time of starting my business, I was not completely aware of the overall goal. I was just trying to progress one step ahead of the step before.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">The application process to enter Smorgasburg is a daunting experience. Over a hundred businesses send their applications hoping to be selected, and among the businesses with potential to succeed with lowest risk of failure are filtered again to fit the variety of menu options available at Smorgasburg.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">No one wants to see fried chicken at every stall or specialty scallion pancake wraps more than once. Fortunately, the menu I presented allowed me a tasting with Smorgasburg's organizers. I went into their office, cooked my menu items, recited a script claiming how my menu was culturally significant, answered their questions, and left.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Initially, they said they weren't sure my menu would work and told me to develop my concept. They were afraid I wouldn't be able to keep up the business at their high-volume market, which would make me unable to pay their rent. If they were to reserve one of their limited spots for me and I happen to fail, quit, and not come back, they would have to scramble for another vendor to replace me.</p>
      
      <p className="blog-text">My heart sunk. If I wasn't starting this business, I would have to go back to another day job. I replied through email and enforced my conviction for my menu, and ended with, "As for experience, this is my 3rd year with Smorg and I've worked at nearly every venue from Summerstage, outdoors Seaport market, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Bridge Park, Ft. Greene, Prospect Park, so I'm already a step ahead of most people."</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Two weeks later, they accepted my proposal and I was allowed to start! Send those follow-up emails, people. They work. I was ecstatic, beyond elated. This was the beginning of something else, something I'd never done before, something big and meaningful I'd been waiting for, finally.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Then, I suddenly felt the weight of all the responsibility. Everything is different when your savings are invested into your job. Suddenly, everything matters, and there are no breaks. Livelihood is a real thing. You're in charge of everything, and there are real consequences. No wonder most people don't start their own businesses.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">To ease the pain of stressful responsibility, I asked a friend to help me, Eddie Kim, a great cook I previously worked with at INSA. Despite Eddie being a professional cook, I had more experience with the high volume and culture of Smorgasburg, and I knew we had to create a malleable menu catering to the complex tastes of Smorgasburg customers.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">The menu had to be eccentric but familiar, sophisticated but not complicated, and versatile enough for setup every morning. This was not gourmet dishes or a gastronomy experience, nor was it hot dogs and funnel cake. The food had to be something in the middle, and it had to be resilient to expiration, simple to store and transport to the outdoor markets.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Unknowingly, by the end of the first season I open, my menu will have changed 3 times, from braised short ribs to buttered-rice burgers and pork belly, to fried chicken karaage and curry fish balls.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Before all of that though, we tested recipes for braised short-ribs, sauces, and braised pork belly. Eddie Kim's cooking is amazing, and even now, the flavor of the short-rib he made has been unattainable by me. A unicorn flavor, if you will.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">From this menu, I searched for reliable wholesale places for ingredients, and spent thousands on kitchen and booth equipment. Everything costs money, and I was really digging into my savings. Til this point, I never even realized utensils obviously cost money as well. As do gloves, straws, soy sauce, and containers to hold everything. The next time you grab a handful of napkins that you might not need, remember, someone had to pay for them. I had gone through half of my 10K savings in the first two weeks.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">In addition to that, I needed my dad's SUV to transport the supplies, meaning he'd drive to NYC from Philly every weekend to lend me the vehicle. And though I don't regret my choices, I still feel sorrow and apologetic for what I did next.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Despite having agreed to a 60–40 split of profits with Eddie Kim, 60 in my favor, I felt I was doing more than 60% of the work. I applied for the food licenses, handled all the logistics of the business involving the booth, the supply of the ingredients, the financials, and the transport to the vendor site, while Eddie Kim was in charge of the cooking. And so, I told Eddie Kim I deserved more, and wanted to split 65–35.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">This immediately creates a rift between us. Eddie Kim wasn't without his sacrifices either. He didn't have a place in NYC to stay and was couch surfing in order to do this business with me. I understood this, but that didn't excuse the fact I had invested all of the money and provided majority of the resources. I felt there was nothing more I needed to say.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Bitterly, we opened the first weekend.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">The first Saturday is always iffy. There's a chance people may not realize Smorgasburg is opening, or there's a chance everyone had been waiting for it to open. This means the market can be either extremely crowded or completely dead. And I remember it clearly, because this first Saturday was completely dead. It was cloudy, the market was slow, and we honestly did not sell a single thing. For a market that would see consistent customers for 8 hours straight and be completely dead was not a good sign.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">In the middle of this, Eddie Kim and I were contemplating whether or not we should continue with this endeavor. What a horrible start to a business. But of course, the money for the weekend was already put in. $850 dollars each weekend. Not only that but I had already invested over $3000 dollars in equipment, ingredients, and licenses. We didn't expect much better for the next day.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Then, Sunday comes around, it's a nice sunny day, and the market is packed. Exploding. Lines were spilling with people desperately trying to get ahead to order something, anything.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Amid the panic, we started selling. Our menu item was 3 short-ribs on a buttered rice patty on the plate for $12, but when the rice ran out, we started selling 4 short-ribs. To my surprise, even with Eddie Kim's experience, he was unable to keep up. The stress had made him unfocused, and was even snippy with Raquel who was working the cash register. He apologized afterward, but the pressure was real. I wasn't stressed though, because Smorgasburg had been my life for the past 3 years. This kind of traffic wasn't unprecedented, but it did catch us off guard.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">We picked up the slack, reorganized, and nearly 3 hours into the day, we had sold out of short-ribs and pork belly we brought. Maybe we weren't charging enough, or maybe 4 short-ribs were too generous. I told my parents to transport us the rest of the short-rib I had kept in the refrigerator, left behind in the morning because I had falsely assumed the day would be slow.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">They brought it over in thirty minutes, and I upped the price and kept the short-ribs to strictly 3 pieces. Even then, the supply only lasted us another 2 hours, and we'd only sold enough to pay off the rent for the weekend. We had to close prematurely.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Eddie Kim and I started debating what to do. The market was still busy, and we had run through all the short-rib we could've possibly prepared in our small kitchen and just barely made it past half the market day. We realized we didn't have enough resources to support this amount of business, to create enough product to sell to this population of customers. There wasn't enough room to store such a vast amount of food, nor did we have the equipment or manpower to sell it in time.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">I suggested to Eddie Kim a way out. If he wanted to back out of the business, I wouldn't persecute him for it. I could tell he was still bitter about the 65-35 profit split. But regardless of his decision, I would stay because in addition to the fact I had already invested thousands into the business, I had also garnered a resentment to working for other people.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">From 15East to X'ian to all the other restaurants, I'd had enough. I was tired of going from one job to the next while accomplishing nothing meaningful in my life.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">In response, Eddie Kim took the way out. I couldn't blame him, as success of the business looked bleak. Afterwards, he left and that was the last time I've spoken to him. I don't regret my choices, but do feel sorry for the way things turned out.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">This first weekend was a disappointment, but at least I broke even with the rent. I returned home and seriously contemplated my plans. I would have to open in 5 days, and needed to overhaul everything.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Almost immediately the next day, I acquired a second refrigerator, took the short-rib out of the menu because of the horrible profit margin, and started prepping a different menu for a larger customer base. Since Raquel was taking classes part-time and working as key-holder at Vitamin Shoppe, I had to call a college friend who was now residing in NYC to help me as a cashier. Her name is Kandi Haro, and I am forever grateful for her help and her friendship. She remains one of the few friends from college I've kept in contact with, and I definitely owe her a dinner.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">When the weekend came by, we were ready. I was cook, Kandi would work as cashier, and my father would help with any other random tasks. When the lines started, we started. We fired up the grill, started taking orders, and we kept selling all the way to the end of the day.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">We made it, and I couldn't believe it. For the first time in my life, I had planned with a purpose, and succeeded. In addition to that, we made a hefty sum of money I could even brag about. Another milestone, this was the most money I'd ever made. In two days, I made more than two months at Zipcar.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">People say breaking even is the goal for any starting business, but we did substantially better. By the end of it all, we had an average of 200 customers a day, and maintained a 25% profit margin.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Later in the season when Raquel had more time, I was able to pay her more money in two days than an entire week at Vitamin Shoppe. I did the same for my father, who I can tell cared little for the money, and instead derived more joy from the experience of running a business with his son than anything else he'd ever done.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">After the season was over, I splurged, and went on a trip with Raquel and a group of friends to Japan for an entire month. When you accomplish something big in your life, everything feels deserved, and I fell in love with the feeling. Which is why 3 months later, I would spontaneously open my own pop-up restaurant in Hawaii.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">A partial venting and recollection of the prime of my life.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">TLDR: What began as a trip to visit Raquel's mother for Christmas became a small business venture. I spontaneously start a pop-up during a vacation stay in Ala Moana Mall, Honolulu.</p>

      <div className="blog-image">

      </div>

      <p className="blog-text">I wouldn't say I like to do spontaneous things, as I've always liked to stay within my comforts, but I will say that I've done a lot of spontaneous things. Maybe I'm looking for ways to break out of my comfort zone. I don't know, I'm not a doctor. But perhaps the greatest accomplishment I've had so far, beyond finding the woman of my dreams, was this spontaneous business venture I indulged in during my stay in Hawaii.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">In the winter of 2017 during a well-earned break from a season of Smorgasburg, Raquel and I decided to visit her mother in Hawaii for a month. We booked our tickets to arrive at the start of December, and to depart the beginning of January. I've stayed in her house in Hawaii for longer before, the first time when Raquel and I had both left Japan to return to the states we decided to stop off in Hawaii for a time.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Hawaii is different. Things are expensive, life is calm, and there are Asians everywhere. You wouldn't believe how different things are until you see Asians on almost every commercial on television. It was only then I realized just how white washed American TV is, and how different Hawaii remains.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">First thing first, Raquel's house is huge. One section of her 3-part living room was devoted to a minibar and a pool table. I couldn't believe it when I first saw the inside, and my eyes gleamed knowing her family had more money than mine.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">Despite being born and raised as a city boy in NYC, I can say without a fraction of doubt I would enjoy living in Hawaii. I'm one of the New Yorkers who grew up with subways, walking fast on the street for reasons that didn't demand it, and jay-walked every crosswalk. Regardless of these learned habits, I enjoy the calm life, the ocean breeze, the constant greenery everywhere. You have to drive wherever you're going, sure, but the roads are calm, other than the idiots who don't signal, and there are a lot of those in Hawaii.</p>

      <p className="blog-text">So, on one of the outings with Raquel's mom to Ala Moana Mall, the biggest mall in Oahu island and probably all of Hawaii, we visited Shirokiya. As I mentioned, there are a lot of Asians in Hawaii, </p>
